# solitare-ai
Solitaire game using AI. Implemented in Python/Pygame

For now, I'm i have all of the basic frontend stuff necessary.
The only thing missing is the movement of a pile of cards from one table's pile to another. 
It might be tricky since my functions will have to detect the exact stack of cards I want to move. Maybe I will have to resize. 

Optimization : 
- the event_triggered method should not be this fat : if should serve as a distrivuter and picks the good methods from each class to operate actions.
